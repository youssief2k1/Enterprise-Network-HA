# Enterprise-Network-HA
Full-scale enterprise network simulation focused on high availability and redundancy. This project builds a hierarchical network with VLANs, RSTP, and HSRP for seamless failover. It integrates OSPF as the IGP within AS 400 and uses eBGP to connect to two other external autonomous systems (AS 200, AS 300). Includes NAT and DHCP.
