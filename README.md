# Enterprise-Network-HA
Full-scale enterprise network simulation focused on high availability and redundancy. This project builds a hierarchical network with VLANs, RSTP, and HSRP for seamless failover. It integrates OSPF as the IGP within AS 400 and uses eBGP to connect to two other external autonomous systems (AS 200, AS 300). Includes NAT and DHCP.
# 🏢 Enterprise Network Infrastructure Project

## 📘 Overview
This project focuses on the **design and implementation of a secure, scalable, and high-availability enterprise network**.  
It demonstrates core networking technologies and best practices for redundancy, routing, and network security using Cisco devices.

## 🧩 Key Features
- **VLAN Segmentation:** VLANs 10, 20, 30, 40 for traffic isolation and scalability.  
- **Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP):** Loop prevention with primary and secondary root bridge.  
- **HSRP:** Gateway redundancy for high network availability.  
- **Dynamic Routing:** OSPF for internal routing, BGP for ISP connectivity.  
- **DHCP & DNS Servers:** Automated IP assignment and name resolution.  
- **NAT/PAT:** Enables internal and external network communication.  
- **ACLs:** Traffic control and security filtering.  
- **DHCP Snooping:** Prevents rogue DHCP attacks.  
- **Telnet Access:** Remote device management and troubleshooting.

## 🖥️ Devices Used
- 12 PCs  
- 6 Access Switches  
- 4 Multilayer Switches  
- 4 Routers  
- 3 Servers (2 DNS + 1 Web Server)

## ⚙️ Technologies & Protocols
- VLANs, RSTP, HSRP  
- OSPF, BGP
